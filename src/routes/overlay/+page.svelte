    Welcome to the overlay home page! Access the relevant pages below:
    <br>
    <span class="text-5xl">
        <a class="text-yellow-400 underline" href="/overlay/control">Control</a> page; <a class="text-yellow-400 underline" href="/overlay/display">Display</a> page
    </span>
    <br>
    <br>
    <span class="font-serif italic">What is this?</span>
    <br>
    In OBS, you can have browser windows as a source. This means that you can load the contents of any website and use it as a streaming overlay.
    <br>
    These two pages are a pair of tools that can be used for streaming snooker; the display page is what is shown on the OBS stream and contains live scores, and the control page is a remote control used to show scores and trigger stats and such.
    <br>
    The two pages are connected via a P2P connection using WebRTC.
